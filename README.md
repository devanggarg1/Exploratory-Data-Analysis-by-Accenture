Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method or philosophy for data analysis that makes use of a range of methods

The EDA process is iterative:

1. Create inquiries regarding your data.

2. By visualizing, transforming, and modeling your data, look for solutions.

3. Refine your queries or develop new ones based on what you discover.

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis
How can you be certain that you are prepared to employ machine learning algorithms in a project?
How do you pick the best algorithms for your data set?
How should feature variables that could be used in machine learning be defined?
All of these issues are answered with the aid of exploratory data analysis (EDA), assuring the optimum results for the project. It is a method for enumerating, displaying, and becoming acquainted with a data set's key features.

Data science projects benefit from exploratory data analysis because it ensures that future findings will be reliable, appropriately understood, and applicable to the desired business settings closer to reality. Only when the raw data has been confirmed and examined for abnormalities, confirming that the data set was accurately acquired, can such a level of certainty be attained. Insights that were not obvious or deserving further investigation by business stakeholders and data scientists but could be very instructive about a certain organization are also discovered using EDA.

Gaining knowledge of your data is what you want to accomplish with EDA.

Utilizing questions to direct your research is the simplest method to accomplish this. When you pose a question, it directs your attention to a particular area of your dataset and aids in your decision-making regarding the graphs, models, or transformations to apply.

EDA is, at its core, a creative process. Like most creative processes, the secret to asking good questions is to develop many of them. As you begin your research, you have no idea what insights your dataset may have, making it challenging to pose illuminating queries.

Conversely, every new inquiry you make will reveal a fresh perspective on your data.

I will define variation and covariation, then demonstrate various approaches to each question's solution. Let us define a few terms to make the conversation simpler:

An identifiable amount, quality, or property is referred to as a variable.
A variable's state at the time of measurement is its value. A variable's value could vary from measurement to measurement.
A collection of measurements performed in a similar environment constitutes an observation (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). Each value in an observation will be connected to a distinct variable. An observation will occasionally be referred to as a data point.
A set of values with each one connected to a variable and an observation makeup tabular data. Tabular data is organized if each value is put into a separate "cell," each variable into a separate column, and each observation into a separate row.
Variation
The tendency of a variable's values to shift from measurement to measurement is known as variation.

Real-world variance examples include taking two measurements of any continuous variable and finding two different responses. This holds true even when measuring unchanging numbers, such as the speed of light. There will be a little amount of error in each of your measures, which will vary from measurement to measurement. If you compare categorical variables across several subjects or historical periods, they may also differ. Every variable has a unique pattern of variation that can disclose user data. Visualizing the distribution of the variable's values is the most effective technique for comprehending that pattern.

Uses of EDA
Spotting errors and anomalies, gaining fresh knowledge from data
Identifying data outliers, 
checking presumptions recognizing critical data elements recognizing relationships,
EDA is utilized to determine our next moves concerning the data, which is arguably the most important. As an illustration, we might need to undertake new research or find answers to brand-new questions.
